It uses highly informal slang ('Yooo', 'fire', 'fam'), an emoji (🔥) to emphasize meaning, and an overall very casual and enthusiastic tone. These linguistic choices are characteristic of Gen Z and young millennials and are less frequently adopted by older demographics, especially in a public-facing professional context like LinkedIn."

The overall tone is enthusiastic and direct, characteristic of young professionals navigating their initial career steps."
